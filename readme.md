# Flysystem Cache Adapter

This adapter is a decorator that caches file metadata to improve performance.

## Why this library?

It supports Flysystem v3 and is currently maintained, which makes it superior to existing alternatives:

- `league/flysystem-cached-adapter` (only supports Flysystem v1 which is no longer maintained)
- `lustmored/flysystem-v2-simple-cache-adapter` (doesn't appear to be maintained since January 2022)

## Installation

```bash
composer require jgivoni/flysystem-cache-adapter
```
